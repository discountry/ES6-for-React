## const

### Defination

> Constants are block-scoped, much like variables defined using the let statement. The value of a constant cannot change through re-assignment, and it can't be redeclared.

### Syntax

```js
const name1 = value1 [, name2 = value2 [, ... [, nameN = valueN]]];
```

### Examples

```js
const hello = 'hi'
```

### Usage

```jsx
const Title = <h1>Learn React</h1>
```
